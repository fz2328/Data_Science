library(tibble)
```


I'm an R Markdown document! 

# Section 1

Here's a **code chunk** that samples from 
a _normal distribution_:

```{r}
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

# Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r round (mean(samp), 2)`.

# Section 3

This is going to make a plot.First, I generate a dataframe, then I use `ggplot` to generate a histogram. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, chunk_histogram}


plot_df = tibble(
  x = rnorm(1000),
  y = 1 + 2 * x + rnorm(1000)
)

ggplot(plot_df, aes(x = x)) + geom_histogram()
```

#Section 4

## resolution to learning assessment

```{r}
Fendi = tibble (
      norm = rnorm(500, mean = 1),
      logical = norm >0,
      abs_norm = abs(norm)
)

ggplot(Fendi, aes(x = abs_norm)) + geom_histogram()
```
